This software is written in Pythonâ„¢ 3.10.

- Packages needed for Av_Ints_software to work are listed in the requirements.txt file.

        Of course all the dependecies of these packages listed in requirements.txt must be 
        fulfilled: you will be required to install matplotlib, PIL and some others. Depending 
        on the installation technique, the Python installer can take care of this directly, or 
        you will have to do this manually. 


Av_Ints_software was developed on the operative system Linux Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit 
        and tested on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit, but it should work on Windows and Mac too.

 
- Run Av_Ints_software:
	Once all the packages are correctly installed, download all the files into a folder,
	then open a terminal (in Linux and Mac, or a cmd in Windows), move into the folder just
	created and run
 
	'python3 Av_Ints_main.py'
	
	The graphical user interface will pop up and let you work.
